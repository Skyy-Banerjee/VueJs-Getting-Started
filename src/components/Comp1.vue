	<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
	<p>
		HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to
		create web pages and applications. It defines the structure and content of
		web content, such as paragraphs, lists, images, and data tables. HTML is
		free and relatively easy to read, using plain English text with extra
		symbols. HTML elements are designated by tags, with most elements having an
		opening tag and a closing tag.
